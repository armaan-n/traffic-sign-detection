# About

This project is a web app that utilizes a keras model to classify and localize 36 different types of traffic signs.

# How To Run

Clone the repository. Run the `main.py` file in the `api` directory using using a python 3.10 interpreter (ensure the requirements in `requirements.txt` are satisfied), 
then call `npm run dev` within the `site/traffic_sign_detection` directory. Once both applications are running, the website should be accessible locally.
