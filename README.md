# About

This project is a web app that utilizes a keras model to classify and localize 36 different types of traffic signs.

# How To Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the requirements in `requirements.txt` are satisfied (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the `main.py` file in the `api` directory using using a python 3.9 interpreter.
4. Call `npm run dev` within the `site/traffic_sign_detection` directory (ensure you have the `next` npm package installed, i.e. run `npm install next`).
5. Once both applications are running, the website should be accessible locally.
